## Reflection
### How many data your publisher program will send to the message broker in one run?

There are 5 data that my publisher program will send to the message broker in one run. It can be seen inside the `main` function that there are 5 user_created data.

### The url of: “amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672” is the same as in the subscriber program, what does it mean?

It means that Subscriber and Publisher are connected to the same AMQP protocol, which runs on the default port 5672.
